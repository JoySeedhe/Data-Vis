# Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to exploring and presenting data through various visualization techniques. It uses Python and modern libraries to create dashboards and charts that enable users to uncover insights and trends in data.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with data through dynamic and interactive visuals.
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Suitable for finance, healthcare, education, and other industries.
- **Customizable Layouts**: Tailor dashboards to specific needs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Matplotlib**: For static 2D plots.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical graphics.
- **Plotly**: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
